===========

Test of asynchronous flask communication with web page. 

This repository is a sample flask application that updates a webpage using a background thread for all users connected.
It is based on the very useful Flask-SocketIO code from Miguel Grinberg.

https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO

To use - please clone the repository and then set up your virtual environment using the requirements.txt file with pip and virtualenv. You can achieve this with:


    git clone https://github.com/shanealynn/async_flask
    cd async_flask
    virtualenv flaskiotest
    ./flaskiotest/Scripts/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt  #(or in Windows - sometimes python -m pip install -r requirements.txt )



Start the application with:

<code>
python application.py
</code>

And visit http://localhost:5000 to see the updating numbers.
